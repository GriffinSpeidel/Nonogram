# Nonograms

[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)

In the nonogram puzzle game, you must deduce which cells on the board should be filled in. You have clues for each row and column that indicate the order and size of consecutive regions of filled in cells. For instance, the clue 2 4 3 means that a row or column has 2 filled in cells, some white space, 4 filled in cells, white space, 3 filled in cells, white space, 4 cells. There may be any amount of white space before or after filled regions.

## Controls

Use left click to fill a cell and right click to block off a cell if you are certain that it is empty. You can undo each action by clicking again. When you want to test your solution, click "CHECK SOLUTION".

## Boards

This game has three boards of varying size. The boards "Test" and "Medium" are fairly simple. I'm pretty sure "Big Board" is solvable but I got messed up and couldn't do it in time... can you? If you want to make more boards, add them to the "boards" folder. They must be squares comprised of 0s and 1s.

## Running the game

If you are using a Windows computer, use the executable located in the "Windows" folder. You must run the exe in the same folder as the .pck file and boards folder.
